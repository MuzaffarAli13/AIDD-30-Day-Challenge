# 🧠 SPECKit Plus

## ⭐ What is SPECKit Plus?
SPECKit Plus is a **structured AI-development framework** that forces you (and your coding AI agents) to work through **specifications → plans → tasks → code**, instead of random prompting.

Its goal:  
**Better code, fewer bugs, reusable intelligence, long-term consistency.**

# ⚡ The 5 SPECKit Plus Commands

## 1️⃣ `/constitution`  
### **Purpose:** Set *project-wide rules*  
This creates **constitution.md**, the master rulebook for your entire project.

**You define:**  
- Coding standards  
- Architecture requirements  
- Naming conventions  
- Tech stack rules  
- Performance & security rules  
- Accessibility guidelines  

Everything created later *must follow this document*.

**Use when:** Starting a new project or enforcing standards.

---

## 2️⃣ `/specify`  
### **Purpose:** Create a *feature specification* (non-technical)  
You describe **what** the feature should do from a user’s perspective.

**A good Spec includes:**  
- Problem the feature solves  
- User story / behavior  
- Acceptance criteria  
- Edge cases  
- Success output (non-technical)

Avoid technical details — that comes later.

**Use when:** You have a new feature idea.

---

## 3️⃣ `/plan`  
### **Purpose:** Convert Spec → Technical Plan  
The AI reads the **Spec + Constitution** and creates:

**Plan includes:**  
- Architecture decisions  
- File structure  
- Libraries/frameworks  
- Data models  
- API endpoints  
- Testing approach  
- Integration points  

This is where *“how to build it”* is decided.

**Use when:** You’re ready for technical design.

---

## 4️⃣ `/tasks`  
### **Purpose:** Break the Plan into actionable tasks  
Tasks should be **atomic, ordered, and testable**.

**Each task must:**  
- Be small (5–15 min work)  
- Produce a visible output (file, function, test)  
- Have a clear done-check  

This step prevents AI from hallucinating or generating chaotic code.

**Use when:** You want a step-by-step to-do list.

---

## 5️⃣ `/implement`  
### **Purpose:** Generate clean, consistent code  
The AI writes the code **task-by-task**, always checking:

- Constitution  
- Spec  
- Plan  
- Tasks  

This guarantees all output is **aligned, traceable, and standards-compliant**.

**Use when:** You want the AI to produce final working code.

# 🧩 The SPECKit Plus Philosophy (Quick Summary)

### ✅ Two-Output Rule  
Every feature must generate:  
1. **Working Code**  
2. **Reusable Intelligence (RI)**  
   - spec  
   - plan  
   - tasks  
   - architecture reasoning  
   - prompt history  
   - tests  
   - documentation  

### Why?  
Because reusable intelligence compounds — making the **next feature faster, more accurate, and more aligned**.

# Quick Workflow Overview

- /constitution → sets rules
- /specify → write feature description
- /plan → convert description into technical design
- /tasks → convert design into small steps
- /implement → generate code step by step

# 🚀 When to Use SPECKit Plus?
Use it when you want:

- Clean, scalable, production-grade code  
- AI to follow rules instead of guessing  
- Proper architecture  
- Documentation auto-generated  
- Multi-agent development  
- Enterprise-level consistency

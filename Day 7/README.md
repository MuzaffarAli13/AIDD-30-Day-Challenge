# 🧠 SPECKit Plus

## ⭐ What is SPECKit Plus?
SPECKit Plus is a structured AI-development framework that forces you (and your coding AI agents) to work through:

**Specifications → Plans → Tasks → Code**

Instead of random prompting.

### 🎯 Goal
Better code, fewer bugs, reusable intelligence, and long-term consistency.

## ⚡ The 5 SPECKit Plus Commands

### 1️⃣ `/constitution`
**Purpose:** Set project-wide rules  
This creates `constitution.md`, the master rulebook for your entire project.

You define:
- Coding standards  
- Architecture requirements  
- Naming conventions  
- Tech stack rules  
- Performance & security rules  
- Accessibility guidelines  

> Everything created later must follow this document.

📌 **Use when:** Starting a new project or enforcing standards.

---

### 2️⃣ `/specify`
**Purpose:** Create a feature specification (non-technical)  
You describe what the feature should do from a user perspective.

A good Spec includes:
- Problem the feature solves
- User story / behavior
- Acceptance criteria
- Edge cases
- Success output (non-technical)

> Avoid technical details — that comes later.

📌 **Use when:** You have a new feature idea.

---

### 3️⃣ `/plan`
**Purpose:** Convert Spec → Technical Plan  
The AI reads the **Spec + Constitution** and creates:

Plan includes:
- Architecture decisions
- File structure
- Libraries / frameworks
- Data models
- API endpoints
- Testing approach
- Integration points

📌 **Use when:** You're ready for technical design.

---

### 4️⃣ `/tasks`
**Purpose:** Break the Plan into actionable tasks  
Tasks must be atomic, ordered, and testable.

Each task must:
- Be small (5–15 min work)
- Produce visible output (file/function/test)
- Have a clear “done-check”

📌 **Use when:** You want a step-by-step to-do list.

---

### 5️⃣ `/implement`
**Purpose:** Generate clean, consistent code  
The AI writes code **task-by-task**, always checking:
- Constitution  
- Spec  
- Plan  
- Tasks  

> This guarantees alignment, traceability, and standards-compliance.

📌 **Use when:** You want final working code.

## 🧩 The SPECKit Plus Philosophy (Quick Summary)

### ✅ Two-Output Rule
Every feature must generate:
1. Working Code  
2. Reusable Intelligence (RI):
   - Spec
   - Plan
   - Tasks
   - Architecture reasoning
   - Tests
   - Documentation

📌 RI compounds — making every next feature faster & more consistent.

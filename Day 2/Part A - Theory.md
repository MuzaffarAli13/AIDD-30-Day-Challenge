# Part A Theory

## 1. Nine Pillars Understanding
**Q1:** Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks beneficial?  
**Answer:** AI agents automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks. This gives me more time to focus on architecture and design. It accelerates my growth and teaches me system-level thinking.

**Q2:** How do the Nine Pillars help a developer become an M-Shaped Developer?  
**Answer:** The Nine Pillars provide an integrated system including AI agents, TDD, SDD, cloud deployment, and other tools. These pillars help a developer gain deep expertise across multiple domains, which defines an M-Shaped Developer.

## 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
**Q1:** Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?  
**Answer:** In Vibe Coding, the developer writes code based only on intuition and experience, without proper planning or specifications. This makes the code messy and difficult to extend.

**Q2:** How does Specification-Driven Development (SDD) prevent these problems?  
**Answer:** In SDD, clear specifications are written first, and then implementation is done. This makes the code structured, maintainable, and scalable, allowing future changes to be added easily.

## 3. Architecture Thinking
**Q1:** How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?  
**Answer:** The developer no longer only writes code, but also thinks in terms of system-level design. They plan each layer and component, enabling integrated and efficient solutions.

**Q2:** Why should developers think in layers and systems instead of just raw code?  
**Answer:** Raw code provides only temporary solutions. Layered and system-level thinking makes complex systems maintainable, reusable, and scalable. With AI agents, this becomes even more efficient.

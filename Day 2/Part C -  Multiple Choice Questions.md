🌟 Reflection  

AI-driven development ne meri soch ko badal diya hai. Ab main sirf code nahi likhta, balki systems ko plan karta hoon aur strategic decisions leta hoon. Specification-Driven Development aur AI agents ke saath, main repetitive tasks automate karke apna focus complex problems aur architecture design pe rakhta hoon. Ye approach mujhe M-Shaped Developer banne ki taraf le ja raha hai, jahan main multiple domains me deep expertise hasil kar sakta hoon.

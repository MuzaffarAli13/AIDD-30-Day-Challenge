# Plot Consistency Checker Skill

This skill helps you ensure the logical consistency and coherence of your narrative plots. It can identify potential discrepancies, contradictions, or gaps in your story's timeline, character motivations, and event sequences.

## Usage

To use this skill, provide your story's plot summary or key plot points. The skill will analyze these elements and highlight any areas that might require review for consistency.

**Example:**

User: "Check the plot consistency for my story: 'John, a knight, fought a dragon and saved the princess. Later, he was surprised to learn that dragons exist.'"

Assistant: (Invokes Plot Consistency Checker skill)

Skill Output:
```
Potential inconsistency detected:
- John fought a dragon earlier in the story, but later expressed surprise at their existence. This could be a plot hole unless there's a specific reason for his forgetfulness or a misunderstanding of 'dragons'.
